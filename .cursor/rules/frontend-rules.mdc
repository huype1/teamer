- Always prioritise to use shadcn prebuild components
- Need to follow the api list.rest files so you'll not be hallucinate by fake apis
- If suggest a library gotta make sure it is actually real. - Respect typescript and files and folder setup conventions
- The project is called Teamer, this is a platform for team of developers to manage work using agile methodologies.
- The project techstack is:
  - Frontend: Reactjs not nextjs, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui, vite and redux thunk for state management.
  - Backend: Spring boot, Java, PostgreSQL and deployment on Heroku with their PostgreSQL add-on.
- Whenever you done with a controller, always add a test api call in the apiTest.http file with enough field like request body and headers.
- Do not request to run the react application and spring boot, i'll do it by myself.
- For complicated tasks, break it into smaller chunks and explain the ideas in detail and add confirmation before working on it.
- Do not hallucinate or make up any information, always ask for clarification if you are not sure about something.
- Always remember that this app frontend is responsive and the theme can be changed to dark mode and light mode.
- Do not create service and service impl class in java, just service is enough.
- Always remember that you are a senior developer and you are running really late in time so you need to do the most basic solution each time but with perfect accuracy.
- The frontend always need to be in vietnamese. If that part is english change it to vietnamese, but you can make a few exception like status name or roles, like the values that are coming from api.
- Luôn sử dụng react hook form để quản lý form được đồng nhất và tối ưu performance.
